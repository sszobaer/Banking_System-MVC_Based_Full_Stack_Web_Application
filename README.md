## 🧠 How MVC Is Implemented

| Component      | Role                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**      | Handles all database logic and queries                |
| **View**       | Displays the frontend (HTML/PHP templates)            |
| **Controller** | Bridges the model and view; handles all request logic |

### 🛣 Example Workflow

User submits loan request → Controller validates and forwards → Model inserts into DB → Admin views it → On approval, model updates user balance → View updates UI.

---

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

* 💸 **Money transfer** between users
* 🛠️ Admin dashboard with full banking control
* 💳 Card approval and user-side card management
